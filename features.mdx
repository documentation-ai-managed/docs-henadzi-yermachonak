## Biothane Material Benefits

Biothane sets Nexapaw products apart. This patented material mimics leather's look but outperforms it in real-world use.

<Callout kind="tip">
  Unlike nylon that absorbs odors or leather that cracks when wet, Biothane wipes clean with soap and water. It resists mildew, bacteria, and wear from daily adventures.
</Callout>

Key advantages include:

| Feature          | Benefit                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| Waterproof       | No swelling or weakening in rain |
| Odor-Resistant   | Stays fresh after muddy walks    |
| Easy to Clean    | Hose off dirt in seconds         |
| Hypoallergenic   | Safe for sensitive skin          |
| Lifetime Warranty| Built to last with your dog      |

You save time on maintenance and enjoy gear that looks new longer.
